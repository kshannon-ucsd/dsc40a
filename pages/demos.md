# 💃 Demos

## 1. [Linear Regression]({{ site.baseurl }}/demos/1_linear_regression)
This is a simple demo showing how loss and the function you are trying to learn with linear regression work together.


Recently rebuilt in javascript... but I first built this in python within a jupyter notebook. You can download my notebook [here](https://ucsd.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsc40a/demos/demo_01.ipynb) to dive deeepr.

## 2. [Loss Surface Navigation]({{ site.baseurl }}/demos/2_loss_surfaces)
This demo shows how gradient descent moves through various loss surfaces in 3d and 2d contour maps. It also let's you compare adam to plain gradient descent!
